# Alphabreak

### Alphabreak is an example application of captcha lib, my highschool graduation project.
It demonstrates how captcha breaking can be applied. It does this by breaking the captchas of the deep web market AlphaBay and creating fake accounts. Hereby demonstrating value for law enforcement to help take down illegal marketplaces.
